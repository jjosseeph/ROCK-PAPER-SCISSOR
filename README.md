# ROCK-PAPER-SCISSOR

Hello, this journey was pretty cool as new beginner who have more ambitious.
i had gained more practise untill now even i'm not satisfied how it's but anytime i search on google i agined more codes to add by using commits.

this games was played in console, everyone knows how this game is played which come from asian countries, so the task was to make javascript program project for that game by playing with computer.

yh that was my work.

so far so good!!!
